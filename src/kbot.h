/*
 kbot.h -- KomodoBrain skeleton (WP2.1)

 Minimal brain seam: bots flagged as "komodobots" have their think routed
 through KBot_Frame(), which for this WP delegates 100% to the stock
 frogbot logic (zero behavior change) but stamps its identity into run
 evidence (server log, userinfo, serverinfo).

 Expects g_local.h to have been included first (KTX header convention).
