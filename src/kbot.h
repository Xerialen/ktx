 kbot.h -- KomodoBrain (WP3.3: engage/disengage discipline)

 Brain seam: bots flagged as "komodobots" have their think routed through
 KBot_Frame(), which delegates movement/nav/combat 100% to the stock frogbot
 logic (the WP3.2 null experiment measured pure delegation at control parity,
 -5.6, while the weave cost 25-30 frags/game -- so vanilla actuation stays).

 WP3.3 adds fight DISCIPLINE at the decision level only: a weak kbot
 (disarmed or low stack, see KBot_AvoidFights) never HUNTS -- its positive
 enemy-goal desire is cleared in UpdateGoal, so the vanilla item economy
 sends it collecting instead of re-engaging. Vanilla's own repel machinery
 (negative desire + enemy hunting us) still biases goals away from threats,
 and combat micro (aim, dodge, look_object) is untouched: fights that find
 the bot are still fought with full vanilla skill.

 Expects g_local.h to have been included first (KTX header convention).
